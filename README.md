Periodic Table API
============

Periodic Table is a simple tool for getting information about chemical elements. It returns information such as the atomic number, symbol, and more based on the element provided.

This is a Javascript Wrapper for the [Periodic Table API](https://apiverve.com/marketplace/api/periodictable)

---

## Installation
	npm install @apiverve/periodictable --save

---

## Configuration

Before using the periodictable API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.  
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com)

---

## Usage

The Periodic Table API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/api/periodictable](https://docs.apiverve.com/api/periodictable).  
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```
var periodictableAPI = require('@apiverve/periodictable');
var api = new periodictableAPI({
    api_key: [YOUR_API_KEY],
    secure: true //(Optional, defaults to true)
});
```

### Perform Request
Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```
var query = {
  name: "hydrogen"
};
```

###### Simple Request (using Callback)

```
api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```
